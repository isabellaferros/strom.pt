## Reviewing Cloudflare's IAM and Zero Trust Solutions

As part of my deep dive into Identity and Access Management solutions, I recently tested **Cloudflare's Zero Trust IAM flow**. This review highlights the strengths, areas for improvement, and how it compares to competitors like **Okta, Azure AD, and Ping Identity**.

### What Works Well
- **Ease of Integration:** Setting up Cloudflare Access was straightforward with robust documentation.
- **Security Features:** Built-in support for SSO, MFA, and role-based access control aligns well with Zero Trust principles.
- **Scalability:** Cloudflare’s network ensures performance remains strong even under heavy traffic.

### Areas for Improvement
- **User Experience:** The dashboard can be challenging to navigate for first-time users.
- **Documentation:** While comprehensive, some aspects of integrating with third-party IdPs could be clearer.
